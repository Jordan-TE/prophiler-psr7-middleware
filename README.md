# prophiler-psr7-middleware
This package provides a slim PSR-7 middleware implementation based on the zendframework/zend-stratigility package. The
middleware is responsible for "adding" the Prophiler Toolbar output to the Response object.

Installation
------------

The preferred way of installation is through Composer. Simply add `bitexpert/prophiler-psr7-middleware` as a dependency:

```
composer.phar require bitexpert/prophiler-psr7-middleware
```

How to use it
-------------

Create Prophiler toolbar:

```php
    $prophiler = new \Fabfuel\Prophiler\Profiler();
    $toolbar = new \Fabfuel\Prophiler\Toolbar($prophiler);
```

Set-up your PSR-7 middleware, e.g. by using zendframework/zend-stratigility:

```php
    $request = \Zend\Diactoros\ServerRequestFactory::fromGlobals();
    $response = \Zend\Diactoros\Response();

    $app = new \Zend\Stratigility\MiddlewarePipe();
```

Add the ProphilerMiddleware to the Middleware pipe:

```php
    $app->pipe(new \bitExpert\Http\Middleware\Psr7\Prophiler\ProphilerMiddleware($toolbar));
```
"Execute" the Middleware pipe:

```php
    $response = $app($request, $response);
```
